# Experiment with Confluent

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming system used for stream processing, real-time data pipelines, and data integration at scale. 

Originally created to handle real-time data feeds at LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka quickly evolved from a messaging queue to a full-fledged event streaming platform, capable of handling over one million messages per second, or trillions of messages per day.

Founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka, Confluent provides the most comprehensive Kafka tutorials, training, services, and support. 

Confluent also offers fully managed, cloud-native data streaming services built for any cloud environment, ensuring scalability and reliability for modern data infrastructure needs.

Apache Kafka consists of a storage layer and a compute layer, which enable efficient, real-time data ingestion, streaming data pipelines, and storage across distributed systems. 

Its design facilitates simplified data streaming between Kafka and external systems, so you can easily manage real-time data and scale within any type of infrastructure.
